- <h2>Attack</h2>]

--

.right-column[- against enemies, using weapon(s)
- will have to *test*]

---

# Tests

- flip N cards off the top of your deck
	- N is usually the stat being tested
- look at symbols in upper-left
	- **text does not matter**

--
<h3>.center[Demo!]</h3>

--
- inspiration can be spent 1-for-1 to turn fate icon(s) into success(es)
- discard the tested cards

---

# Attack tests

- test an icon depicted on the weapon
- successes can be spent on weapon abilities
	- only one instance of a given ability during a single attack
- some weapons are ranged
- may induce counterattack

---

# Rally

- shuffle discards back into skill deck
- **Scout** N
	- look at top N cards
	- *prepare* one
	- stack remaining cards on top and/or bottom, in order of your choice

---

# Preparing

--
- now the text is active (and icons ignored)

--
- most skills require discard as a cost to trigger ability

--
- limit: 4 prepared cards

---

# Shadow

--
- each enemy activates
--
, usually to move & attack

--
  - only if ready

--
- then exhausts
	- counterattacks also exhaust

--
- [also threat rises]

---

# Damage/Fear

--
- two separate HP pools

--
- hitting the limit on either triggers a *last stand*

--
- can usually be *negated* via a test

--
- cards suffered face **up** by default

---

# Provoking

- when moving out of a space with a ready enemy, or *interacting* in such a space
- only ready enemies can be provoked
- does not exhaust them

---

# Nearby

--
- *nearby* spaces = 0 or 1 move away
  - so, includes itself

--
- *nearby* hero or token = on nearby spaceâ€¦ but you are **not** nearby yourself

---

# Final points

- **Don't dawdle!**

--
- Test appropriately.

--
	- Don't waste successes or inspiration.

--
	- Know who should test where.

--
	- Many tests require a **cumulative** # of successes.
